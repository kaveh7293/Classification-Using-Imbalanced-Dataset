<h1>Classification-Using-Imbalanced-Dataset</h1>
<h2> Motivation</h2>
<p>In this project, I trained a model to be used for detecting the credit customers whose application might be rejected by the credit card company. This model can be used in the early stages of the customer applications to avoid the customers from losing credit scores. This simple application could increase the customers satisfaction which can in turn increase the credit company revenue by maintaining the credit card customers. For example, company can suggest to these customers new options such as less-demanding credit cards or less credit limit prior to the main application proceeds.<br></p>

<h2>Challange</h2>
<p>The main challange in this study is that the availalble data (please find in this link) is highly imbalanced. Out of 25128 rows of data, only 121 data corresponds to the customers with rejected applications and the rest of the 25007 rows in dataset contains information of the customers whose application got accepted. As such, it is difficult to obtain a model with high prediction quality. In the current project, specific metrics (i.e., f1-score for both prediction classes) and specific approaches (i.e., <strong> undersampling </strong> and <strong>oversampling</strong>) are used to train an appropriate model for classification of this classification model.
